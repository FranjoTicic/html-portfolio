<h1>The best 5 Anime to watch according to Franjo</h1>
<h2>This is the list of best Anime I've watched recently</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One of best world buildings, character development and story-line itself. 10/10 would recommend.</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Amazing battle animations, very likeable characters, great world design.</p>

<h3>Ragna Crimson</h3>
<p>Fresh anime that aired two months ago, amazing story-line with amazing character development,<br/>
Anime itself kind of goes to isekai edition, but the main character has yet to unlock his godlike potential.</p>

<h3>The time I reincarnated as a slime</h3>
<p>Isekai anime with loveable slime main character that does his own world building and does a wonderful job making his kingdom along with various friendships.</p>

<h3>Eminence in the shadow</h3>
<p>I just love this isekai because I love anime bewbs with juicy nice tiddies and big, well shaped, phat bundas.</p>
